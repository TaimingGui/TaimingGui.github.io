            Kanye West lost his only family after the passing of his mother, Donda. Following this, he chose to be with Kim Kardashian, and they went through many ups and downs. However, this relatively long marriage has now come to an end. In this song, "Ye" expresses his feelings of loneliness with the lyrics "Don't wanna die alone," his desire to make his dreams come to life with "Make it all come to life," and his questioning of whether Kim truly came to life with "Did she really come to life."

            You know where to find me, they cannot define me. 
            <br>
            So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave? 
            <br>
            Come and purify me, come and sanctify me. 
            <br>
            You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam.

            Bought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes. 
            <br>
            This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free. 
            <br>
            Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining. 
            <br>
            So when I'm free, I'm free....
